In ref 120 from **1**, simultaneous identification of ascorbic acid, acetaminophen, and tryptophan was successful. What about identification of substrates and products from an enzymatic pathway, or breakdown products that happens from natural hydrolysis in solution? Could you see where the reaction is or determine how old the sample is?

This may require obtaining the probability output of the model, then relating that back to the concentration in the sample. You could (again using a NN) do some sort of regression of probs of A, B, C output of the model, where (A, B, C) are the substrate, intermediate, and end product of a reaction.

In ref 124 from **1**, the components of the horseradish peroxidase reaction were followed, so some of this idea may have already been investigated. At least enzyme products have been quantified via SWV.

Since in refs 125 and 126 from **1** show that SWV has similar sensitivity to HPLC, it seems possible to obtain quantities along with identification. Total % of (ABC) would possibly be kept at a constant 100%, and you'd have % of A, B, C vary dynamically from start to finish.
